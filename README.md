Introduction: The purpose of our library is to Describe what problem the code is solving. You may borrow the Latex expressions from my lecture notes. Discuss in broad strokes what the purpose of the code is along with any features. Do not describe the details of the code yet.
============

Installation: Describe where the code can be found and downloaded. Tell the user how to run the test suite. We are not releasing this code as a package yet, but when we do that this section will include instructions how how to install the package.
